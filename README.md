# Pin Dropper
I have a hobby interest in mapping and have been playing around with Mapbox and custom maps. My [first map](https://github.com/goldenmeanie/smelly) is of lilac bushes that are accessible from the sidewalk in PVD.

My main challenge is a convenient way to record locations when I find them in-person. I’ve tried a couple existing applications, but they have some challenges. So I’m going to try to build an iOS app myself. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
